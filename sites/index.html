<h1>Our Menu</h1>

<h2>chicken</h2>
<p>Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food.</p>
<h2>Beef</h2>
<p>People have eaten the flesh of bovines from prehistoric times; some of the earliest known cave paintings, such as those of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting scenes. People domesticated cattle to provide ready access to beef, milk, and leather.</p>
<h2>sushi</h2>
<p>Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known as narezushi, stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.</p>
